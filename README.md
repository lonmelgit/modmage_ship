You can install this module via composer command: composer require lonmelgit/modmage-ship
The ModMage_Ship module empowers customers to create custom shipping methods and establish corresponding pricing. These methods are then displayed based on conditions set by the client in the grid table. For instance, clients can configure minimum and maximum subtotals or minimum and maximum weights to determine when these methods should be available.
