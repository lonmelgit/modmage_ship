The <b>ModMage_Ship</b> module empowers customers to create custom shipping methods and establish corresponding pricing. These methods are then displayed based on conditions set by the client in the grid table. For instance, clients can configure minimum and maximum subtotals or minimum and maximum weights to determine when these methods should be available.
